"Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes." - Edsger Dijkstra

"People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on eachother, like a wall of mini stones." - Donald Knuth

“The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.”  - Donald Knuth

“The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user.” ― C.A.R. Hoare

"There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.” ― Leon Bambrick
